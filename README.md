# Shopping Cart
A project created using vite and React.ts. It also has context api, json data and page routing. 

At the store section you can add items into your cart and also remove them. If you want to see how many items you have and their total price, you can check the icon that appears after you added your first item into your cart.

Check it out at (at the navbar change the section from home to the store section): https://shopping-typescript.netlify.app/
